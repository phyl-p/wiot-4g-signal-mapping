    "**Project Motivation**:\n",
    "Long range signal transmission can have blind spots well within their proposed rangeâ€“as we have seen for LoRa and BLE, where the theoretical range is a lot shorter or is significantly reduced due to the objects in the environment. LoRa has a proposed range of 3 miles in urban areas, but as shown in the results of the measurements in this class, it can have certain blind spots well within the 3 mile range, especially in underground settings such as basements. 4G/5G are important means of communication on Grounds, and they are relied upon for real time communication in case WiFi fails. Yet, it is sometimes reported that the 4G/5G coverage on Grounds is not ideal, especially in terms of underground environments. The Engineering School has a lot of buildings where the basements are environments where important experiments take place. Having robust and redundant communication is important for the safety of both the faculty, staff, students, and their work. Hence, we propose to measure the 4G/5G coverage in the E-School and around grounds. We will use various internet speed measurement apps on our phones to collect the data at specific geographic locations, indoors and outdoors. Using this data we can then create heatmaps for both indoor and outdoor settings, exploring the differences and enlightening the community to areas of low coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This python notebook is step 3 of our project where we map the collected signal strength data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Mapping Plan:\n",
    "1. map data by type of sinal strenght (upload, download, rssi), floors and their coordinates.\n",
    "2. Collect stats, such as mean, std, and range by floor, building and graph bar chart"
